## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation
```bash
# Always verify package integrity
pip install raptor-ai --trusted-host pypi.org

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install raptor-ai
```

### Configuration
- Never commit credentials or API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review and understand code before running

### Updates
```bash
# Check for updates regularly
pip list --outdated

# Update RAPTOR
pip install --upgrade raptor-ai
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Beta Release Notice

RAPTOR Aigle 0.1 is a **beta release**. While we've taken security seriously:

- Not all features have undergone production-grade security audits
- Some APIs may change in future releases
- We recommend additional security measures for production use

### Dependencies

- We regularly audit our dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Security updates are released as needed
- See `requirements.txt` for current dependencies

## Security Audits

We welcome security audits from the community and professional security researchers.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- All code in the RAPTOR repository
- Dependencies and their usage
- Configuration and deployment recommendations
- API security

**Out of Scope:**
- Physical security
- Social engineering attacks
- Third-party integrations not maintained by us

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make RAPTOR more secure.

### Hall of Fame

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- Listed in our Security Hall of Fame (with permission)
- Credited in security advisories
- Mentioned in release notes

*No vulnerabilities have been reported yet (as of first release).*

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program. However:

- We appreciate responsible disclosure
- We're open to recognition and acknowledgment
