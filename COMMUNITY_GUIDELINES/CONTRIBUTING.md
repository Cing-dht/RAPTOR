## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAPTOR.git
cd RAPTOR

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DHT-AI-Studio/RAPTOR.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd Aigle/0.1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Write your code, following our [coding standards](#coding-standards).

### 5. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run linting
flake8 .
pylint raptor/

# Run type checking (if using type hints)
mypy .

# Check test coverage
pytest --cov=raptor tests/
```

### 6. Commit and Push

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Add feature: description of your feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Go to the [RAPTOR repository](https://github.com/DHT-AI-Studio/RAPTOR) and click "New Pull Request".

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/what-changed` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/what-refactored` - Code refactoring
- `test/what-tested` - Test additions or modifications
- `perf/what-optimized` - Performance improvements

### Keep Your Branch Updated

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch on upstream/main
git rebase upstream/main

# Force push to your fork (if already pushed)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## üíª Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with some modifications:

- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Quotes**: Prefer double quotes for strings
- **Imports**: Organized in three groups (stdlib, third-party, local)

### Code Example

```python
"""Module docstring describing what this module does."""

import os
import sys
from typing import List, Optional

import numpy as np
import torch

from raptor.core import BaseClass
from raptor.utils import helper_function


class MyClass(BaseClass):
    """Class docstring describing the class.
    
    Attributes:
        attribute1: Description of attribute1.
        attribute2: Description of attribute2.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, param1: str, param2: Optional[int] = None):
        """Initialize MyClass.
        
        Args:
            param1: Description of param1.
            param2: Description of param2. Defaults to None.
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
    
    def method_name(self, arg1: List[str]) -> bool:
        """Method description.
        
        Args:
            arg1: Description of arg1.
            
        Returns:
            Description of return value.
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: When arg1 is empty.
        """
        if not arg1:
            raise ValueError("arg1 cannot be empty")
        
        # Implementation
        return True
```

### Documentation Standards

- **All public modules, classes, and functions must have docstrings**
- Use [Google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- Add inline comments for complex logic

### Testing Standards

- **Write tests for all new features and bug fixes**
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage
- Use descriptive test names: `test_feature_under_specific_condition`
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Mock external dependencies

```python
def test_my_function_returns_expected_value():
    """Test that my_function returns the correct value."""
    result = my_function(input_data)
    assert result == expected_value

def test_my_function_raises_on_invalid_input():
    """Test that my_function raises ValueError on invalid input."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        my_function(invalid_input)
```

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

### Examples

```
feat(core): add support for custom model loading

Implement new ModelLoader class that supports loading custom
AI models from various sources including local files and remote URLs.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(utils): resolve memory leak in data preprocessing

Fixed memory leak caused by unreleased resources in the
preprocess_data function. Added proper cleanup in finally block.

Fixes #456
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests in the footer
